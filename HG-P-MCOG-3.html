            Welcome back! Today you will read "The Honeyguide’s Revenge" for the
            third time. Afterwards we will ask you to retell the story. It is
            easier to remember a story if you know that most stories have a
            similar structure as shown here in this chart:

          <div class="introWords">
            A story begins with the <span class="boldWord">exposition</span> -
            this is the part that introduces the characters and the setting and
            gets the story started.
            <br />
            Then the plot gets going with
            <span class="boldWord">rising actions</span> - these are the events
            that lead up to the climax. The rising actions usually involve at
            least one problem that must be solved.
            <br />
            The <span class="boldWord">climax</span> is the point of major
            tension in the story.
            <br />
            After the climax there are
            <span class="boldWord">falling actions</span>. These are plot events
            that lead toward the resolution of the problem or the conflict.
            <br />
            Finally there is the <span class="boldWord">resolution</span> of the
            problem.
            <br />
            Today when you read the story for the last time you can think about
            where the events in the story fit into this story arc.<span

            followed the bird once again. After leading Gingile along the edge
            of the forest, Ngede stopped to rest in a great umbrella thorn.
            “Ahh,” thought Gingile. “The hive must be in this tree.” He quickly
            made his small fire and began to climb, the smoking branch in his
            teeth. Ngede sat and watched.<span
