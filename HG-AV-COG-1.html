            Welcome, my name is Whoo! You will read the story "The Honeyguide's
            Revenge." This story is a folktale told by the Zulu people in
            Africa. A folktale is a traditional story that is passed down from
            one generation to another by word of mouth. Folktales usually
            explain something. Often folktales are a way for older people to
            teach young people how to survive and prosper in the local
            environment. South Africa is a large country with a beautiful and
            varied environment. Here is a video about Africa:

            One day while Gingile was out hunting he heard the call of Ngede.
            Gingile’s mouth began to water at the thought of honey. He stopped
            and listened carefully, searching until he saw the bird in the
            branches above his head. “Chitik-chitik-chitik,” the little bird
            rattled, as he flew to the next tree, and the next.
            <span id="chitik_word">“Chitik, chitik, chitik,”</span> he called,
            stopping from time to time to be sure that Gingile followed.

          <div class="words">
            After half an hour, they reached a huge wild fig tree. Ngede hopped
            about madly among the branches. He then settled on one branch and
            cocked his head at Gingile as if to say, “Here it is! Come now! What
            is taking you so long?” Gingile couldn’t see any bees from under the
            tree, but he <span id="trusted_word">trusted</span> Ngede.

              class="doneButton"

          <div class="words">
            So Gingile put down his hunting spear under the tree, gathered some
            dry twigs and made a small fire. When the fire was burning well, he
            put a long dry stick into the heart of the fire. This wood was
            especially known to make lots of smoke while it burned. He began
            climbing, holding the cool end of the
            <span id="stick_word">smoking stick</span> in his teeth.

            Soon he could hear the loud buzzing of the busy bees. They were
            coming in and out of a hollow in the tree trunk – their
            <span id="hive_word">hive</span>. When Gingile reached the hive he
            pushed the smoking end of the stick into the hollow. The bees came
            rushing out, angry and mean. They flew away because they didn’t like
            the smoke – but not before they had given Gingile some painful
            stings!

          <div class="words">
            When the bees were out, Gingile pushed his hands into the nest. He
            took out handfuls of the heavy comb, dripping with rich honey and
            full of fat, white <span id="grub_word">grubs</span>. He put the
            comb carefully in the pouch he carried on his shoulder, and started
            to climb down the tree.

            Ngede eagerly watched everything that Gingile was doing. He was
            waiting for him to leave a fat piece of honeycomb as a thank-you
            offering to the Honeyguide. Ngede flittered from branch to branch,
            closer and closer to the ground. Finally Gingile reached the bottom
            of the tree. Ngede <span id="perched_word">perched</span> on a rock
            near the boy and waited for his reward.

            But, Gingile put out the fire, picked up his spear and started
            walking home, ignoring the bird. Ngede called out angrily,
            “VIC-torr! VIC-torrr!” Gingile stopped, stared at the little bird
            and laughed aloud. “You want some honey, do you, my friend? Ha! But
            I did all the work, and got all the stings. Why should I share any
            of this lovely honey with you?” Then he walked off. Ngede was
            furious! This was no way to treat him! But he would get his

            One day several weeks later Gingile again heard the honey call of
            Ngede. He remembered the
            <span id="delicious_word">delicious</span> honey, and eagerly
            followed the bird once again. After leading Gingile along the edge
            of the forest, Ngede stopped to rest in a great umbrella thorn.
            “Ahh,” thought Gingile. “The hive must be in this tree.” He quickly
            made his small fire and began to climb, the smoking branch in his
            teeth. Ngede sat and watched.

            Gingile climbed, wondering why he didn’t hear the usual buzzing.
            “Perhaps the hive is deep in the tree,” he thought to himself. He
            pulled himself up another branch. But instead of the hive, he was
            staring into the face of a leopard! Leopard was very angry at having
            her sleep so rudely interrupted. She narrowed her eyes, opened her
            mouth to reveal her very large and very
            <span id="sharp_word">sharp</span> teeth.

          <div class="words">
            Before Leopard could take a swipe at Gingile, he rushed down the
            tree. In his hurry he missed a branch, and landed with a heavy thud
            on the ground twisting his ankle. He hobbled off as fast as he
            could. Luckily for him, Leopard was still too sleepy to chase him.
            Ngede, the Honeyguide, had his revenge. And Gingile learned his
